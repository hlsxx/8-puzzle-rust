# 8-puzzle with Rust

The 8-puzzle is a classic sliding puzzle that consists of a 3x3 grid with eight numbered tiles and one empty space. The goal of the puzzle is to rearrange the tiles by sliding them into the empty space, aiming to achieve a specific configuration, typically with the numbers arranged in ascending order.

## Solve with BFS and DFS algorithms

Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) are two fundamental algorithms used for traversing or searching graph and tree data structures.

## Example
Input matrix:
1 2 3
0 4 6
7 5 8

### Breadth-First Search (BFS)
Depth: 3
Nodes count: 8

### Depth-First Search (DFS)
Depth: 11
Nodes count: 12

![DFS](./images/dfs.jpg?raw=true "DFS")
